    "The Hough Transform for detecting lines and circles differs primarily in the parameter space and computational complexity. For line detection, the Hough Transform uses two parameters: the slope (m) and the intercept (b) in the equation y=mx+b. The parameter space is a 2D plane, where each point in the image space is mapped to a curve in this space, making it computationally simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, detecting circles requires three parameters: the center coordinates (x, y) and the radius (r). This increases the parameter space to 3D, significantly expanding the search space. As a result, circle detection via the Hough Transform is more computationally intensive, requiring more memory and processing time to evaluate the additional parameter (r). The increased dimensionality for circles leads to a higher computational cost compared to line detection."
